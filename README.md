# Bwhiz-Zindi_winning_solution_Excellent_Store_Challenge_by_DSN
**Warning:** Noobie contents imminent.:grin:

This is my **first hackathon** and it is a challenge hosted by Data Science Nigeria (DSN) on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/dsn-pre-bootcamp-hackathon-the-excellent-store-challenge) as a [pre-bootcamp learning competition](https://www.datasciencenigeria.org/2020-75-days-of-ml/).

**In this solution, no ensembling technique was employed or any of the commonly used algorithms for winning hackathons, just the good ol' feature selection and L1 regularization**
**This might seem basic for a winning solution , but in the field of ML, simplicity cannot be over emphasized.**
